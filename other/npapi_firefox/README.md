# npapi_firefox

This container is meant for historical preservation of old NPAPI applications.

I used it to safely find and save tons of old flash games before support for flash is entirely dropped from modern browsers.

Including firefox as a binary for future-proofness.

Unfortunately can't be used for old Shockwave games/apps.
