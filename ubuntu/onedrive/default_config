# Directory where the files will be synced
sync_dir = "/data"
# Skip files and directories that match this pattern
# Note: after changing skip_file, you must perform a full synchronization by executing onedrive --resync
skip_file = ".*|~*"
# Selective sync allows you to sync only specific files and directories.
# To enable selective sync create a file named sync_list in ~/.config/onedrive.
# Each line of the file represents a relative path from your sync_dir.
# All files and directories not matching any line of the file will be skipped during all operations.
# Here is an example of sync_list:
#   Backup
#   Documents/latest_report.docx
#   Work/ProjectX
#   notes.txt
# Note: after changing the sync list, you must perform a full synchronization by executing onedrive --resync
# WARNING:
#   The files and directories in the synchronization directory must follow the Windows naming conventions.
#   The application will crash for example if you have two files with the same name but different case.
#   This is expected behavior and won't be fixed.
