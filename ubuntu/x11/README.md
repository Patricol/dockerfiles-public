# ubuntu/x11

ubuntu/x11/rdp plus things I want every GUI workspace to have, but that aren't needed for setting up or validating the various connection methods.

Adds atom, remmina, terminator, chromium, htop, tree, screen, etc.

Adds customized configuration files for i3 and i3status.

Configures atom; also installing and removing atom packages as desired.
